# Analyzing CIA Factbook using SQL
1. In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

- `population` — the global population.
- `population_growth` — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- `area` — the total land and water area.

2. In this guided project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to query data from this database
3. We'll develop useful summary statistics in this project to query meaningful information from the database
4. Use of nested queries or sub-queries will help us achieve our goal/s
 

**You can find the Jupyter Notebook(code) for this project [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/hussam95/Portfolio/blob/26c49a1f41bbd8b6d02f13287f67b539e635c10c/SQL_CIA_Factbook.ipynb)**
