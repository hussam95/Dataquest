# Experiments With Pytorch Using MNIST Dataset
- In this project, I used Pytorch's builtin dataset (MNIST) to:
1. Build a neural network using Pytorch
2. Train the neural net on the MNIST dataset
3. Make predictions on a test set

P.S: This is a self-initiated project with a view to learn high level working of Pytorch for building, training, and testing neural nets.
