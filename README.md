# Predicting Bike Rentals
Many U.S. cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. The District collects detailed [data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

In this project, I'll try to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. To accomplish this task, I'll use 3 different machine learning algorithms with a view to comapre and contrast their performance:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Ensembled Decision Tree/Random Forest

**The Jupyter Notebook (code) for this project can be found [here.](https://nbviewer.org/github/hussam95/Portfolio/blob/2b35f991af652cd60e19c339412c9fd181feabcc/Predicting_Bike_Rentals_Colab.ipynb)**
