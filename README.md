# Data Analyst Portfolio Projects
- This repository is meant to serve the purpose of a portfolio for any potential employer
- Every branch in this repository represents a seperate project
- Branches are not neccessarily in an increasing order of difficulty
- Branches may reflect my journey from a data analyst to a data scientist 
- Every branch in this repository is my own work which is a guided project offered by Dataquest (online DA, DS, and DE certificator)
- Any self-initiated project will be duly mentioned in the branch's readme.md file
