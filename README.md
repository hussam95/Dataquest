# Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression Model From Scikit-learn
We'll work with a dataset on sold houses in Ames, Iowa. Each row in the dataset describes the properties of a single house as well as the amount it was sold for. In this project, we'll build models that predict the final sale price from its other attributes using linear regression model of scikit-learn.

Originally, the [dataset](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627) has:
- 82 [columns](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/307/data_description.txt) (including target)
- 2930 rows 

Throughout this project, we will engineer new features from the original columns so much so that some of the models we'll build will have as much as 150 features (due attention on relevance with target column will be kept in mind at each step). The project performs complete workflow pipeline, from cleaning to validation of different models.
