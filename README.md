# Predicting House Prices Using Regression in Tensor Flow
In this project, I'll:

1. Build a sequential neural network with 3 hidden layers
2. Train the neural network on a 6 dimensional feature space having 4500 examples describing the properties of houses
3. Validate the network's performance on 500 testing examples using RMSE as my error metric


- **The Jupyter Notebook (code) for this project can be found [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/hussam95/Portfolio/blob/e34e1b3d3e65ce90fd48ac525b29e80f026988ab/Tensor_FLow_Predicting_House_Prices_Using_Regresssion.ipynb)**

P.S: This is a self-initiated project with a view to understand and implement the high-level working of Tensor Flow and Keras by solving a regression problem.
