# Building Handwritten Digits Classifier Using Feedforward Nueral Network

In this project I'll:
- Use [hand-written digits dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits) from UCI to develop a neural network model that will classify the hand written digits (from 0 to 9)
- Tune the neural network's hyperparametrs (number of neurons and hidden layers) 
- Comapre and contrast the performance of neural network and KNeighbors Classifier
