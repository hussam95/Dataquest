# Predicting Car Prices Using Scikit-Learn's KNeighborsRegressor Machine Learning Model

The project uses the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm to predict the car prices utilizing:

- Python's Scikit-learn libarary to perform machine learning operations
- Extensive use of Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn etc. to clean and visualize the [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile)
- Univariate and Multivariate model development 
- Train/Test Validation technique 
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Attribute selection
