# Builiding, Compiling, Training, Testing, and Saving a Neural Network in Tensor Flow 
In this project I'll: 
1. Build a simple Tensorflow model to solve a [regression problem](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength)
2. Train and test the model
3. Save model to disc and reload it to a Jupyter Notebook for reuse

I will use following packages to acheive this:
- Tensor Flow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
