# Solving Simple NLP Problem in Pytorch

In this project I'll:
1. Use Pytorch to build a neural network
2. Use spam/ham data to train the network using batch gradient descent
3. Test the network's performance on a testing set
4. Use Tokenizer from keras to preprocess the text data

P.S: This is a self-initiated project to learn high level working of Pytorch. Moreover, the goal of this project was also to learn preprocessing of text data to better handle NLP problems in future.
