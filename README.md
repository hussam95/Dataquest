# Classifying Breast Cancer Patients Using Multiclass Logistic Regression
Logisitic regression helps us classify a dependent variable. In this project, we will use this technique to classify breast cancer patients as having moderately malignant(1), malignant(2), extremly malignant(3) tumor. We'll use **one-versus-all appraoch** (details later) in our logistic regression model.

We will use [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer) having 9 categorical features. We'll engineer new features in this project to train and test our logistic regression model. 

Remember, the probability of correctly predicting the extent of breast cancer malignancy with three classes is 33.3%. This is because we have to pick 1 out of 3 options randomly. If our model gives us results better than this, it means the logistic regression has improved our capability of assigning degree of malignancy to a certain cancer patient. - **
